# Migrate to new url

You are **not required** to switch to the new url ([repeatio.de](https://repeatio.de)) the old url ([repeatio.netlify.app](https://repeatio.netlify.app)) will continue to work.

Repeatio saves all files (modules, settings, ...) in the browser's storage.
This storage is specific to the URL and cannot be accessed from a different URL.
To transition from [repeatio.netlify.app](https://repeatio.netlify.app) to [repeatio.de](https://repeatio.de), you need to export and then import all files.
To migrate from  to repeatio.de it is required to export and reimport all files.
